"""ExchangeOrderClient port.

The trip use case calls this to:
  - cancel_all_orders(): bulk-cancel every open order on the
    exchange for the configured symbols.
  - close_all_positions(): flatten every active position with a
    market order.

The order-execution use case (H4) calls:
  - place_composite_order(): places a market entry + SL + TP
    bracket order.
  - place_emergency_market(): last-resort liquidation if SL
    placement fails after retry exhaustion.

Sad path: any I/O failure (CCXT timeout, exchange 5xx, auth)
raises ExchangeOrderClientError.
